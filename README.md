BASIC DETAILS OF THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND TEAM MEMBERS:-
Problem Statement:An expansive number of staff is utilized for meter readings and other related assignment like bill payments.
Billing errors due to the carelessness of meter readers during meter reading and sometimes billing estimation. Careless use of electricity by consumers who are unaware of its cost. 
Sometimes consumer use dirty tricks like tampering with meters to reduce their bill.
SOLUTION:The project aims to develop an Energy Sentinel with ESP32 and Blynk App, providing users with:
Intuitive platform for monitoring
Analysis of energy usage patterns
Real-time optimization capabilities
to foster energy efficiency and sustainability

The proposed setup is a single-phase energy metre monitoring system built on top of a smart metre, also known as a digital metre, which is a device that can wirelessly track a user's daily electricity consumption and display data from a smartphone, including voltage, current, power, unit conversion, and price.
The Components we have used are:
1)PZEM-004T
2)ESP32 
3)OLED
4)CA1235
6)LED BULB 
7)JUMPER WIRES 
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: In an enormously populous country like India, where residential housing and industrial structures are densely populated, gathering accurate metre readings is a massive operation that demands a significant amount of labour and long workdays. These ultimately raise the operating costs for the energy provider, which has an impact on consumers' electricity prices.
ENERGY SENTINEL  offers a solution to the issues that distribution and consumer industries are now facing. encountered by the distribution firms as well as the customers. The smart energy metre used in this project makes use of embedded system characteristics to implement the required functionalities. 
This abstract presents a comprehensive overview of a system designed to monitor electrical parameters such as voltage, current, energy and also it shows unit and price using the PZEM-004T module, interface with an ESP32 microcontroller, and display the data on an OLED display and Blynk configuration.
The setup involves connecting the PZEM-004T module to the ESP32 via UART communication and configuring the ESP32 for I2C communication with the OLED display. 
Additionally, an 18650 battery powers the system through a voltage regulator (CA1235), ensuring stable operation. Integration with the Blynk app allows remote monitoring and control of the ESP32.
Overall, this system enables real-time monitoring and remote management mentioned in above parameter in various applications.
